## Introduction

Tool created for the __EMV__ group for testing the product in a clean and simpler way. The tool has been developed in __JavaFX__ to be cross-platform and can also be used through the command line so that the testing can be automated.

The GUI contains three major parts:

1. Tests: where the java tests can be included to be run.
2. Output: where the output of the tests will be logged.
3. Side toolbars: where some commonly used commands can be sent directly.
