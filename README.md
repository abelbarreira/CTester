## Characteristics

- __Cross-platform__.
- __Self-contained__: the tool won't have to be recompiled if a test changes.
- __Configurable__: things than are likely to change are configured through an `.xml` file.
- Run through __GUI__ and __command line__.

## Developing a test

1. Clone the following template located in: `git:XXX`

2. Checkout `develop` branch.

3. Open the project with NetBeans.

4. Create a test inside that extends the class `AbstractTest`, located in the package `com.lsc.ctesterfx.test`.

5. Implement the logic inside the `run` method and return `true` or `false` if the execution is succesful or not.

Note: The tests can be located anywhere, there's no restrictions about package naming neither. However, do notice that a java file, in order to be compiled have to be inside the folder structure have to match the package name. Here's some examples:

```#comment
package testing;

Folder structure:
    /testing
       test.java
```

```#comment
package testing.performance;

Folder structure:

    /testing
      - /performance
           test.java
```
